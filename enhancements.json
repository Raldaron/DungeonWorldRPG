IED (Improvised Explosive Device) It\u2019s one thing to take a grenade and toss it. But it takes a set of brass balls the size of basilisk eggs to actually build a bomb. Especially with the unreliable crap you find down here. Every level of this skill increases the damage yield of improvised explosive devices by 10% and decreases the chances of a catastrophic, premature uh-oh by half. Incendiary Device Handling Incendiary Device Handling makes you the pyromaniac\u2019s best friend, improving your ability to burn things down\u2014preferably things that aren't you or your idiot friends. Perfect for those who enjoy the smell of napalm in the morning but don\u2019t have the attention span to actually handle explosives with care. Light on Your Feet Light on Your Feet lets you prance around the battlefield like a caffeinated pixie on a sugar high. Leap over enemies, avoid attacks, and escape traps\u2014all while your companions curse your name for being such an insufferable show-off. Because nothing says \"team player\" like leaving everyone else to take the hits. Love Vampire Love Vampire lets you redirect damage to your enemies, because why suffer the consequences of your own bad choices when you can make someone else pay for them? Perfect for those who think empathy is for losers and just want to survive another round of poorly planned heroics. Mascot Mascot gives your pet a starring role in every battle, boosting party morale while simultaneously making everyone question their life choices. Your animal companion becomes the MVP, while you bask in its reflected glory, knowing that even a flea-ridden mutt is more useful than you. Regeneration Regeneration lets you bounce back from injuries like a rubber band that just refuses to snap. Perfect for those who take the \u201cliving on the edge\u201d mantra a little too literally and want to keep cheating death, over and over again, much to the annoyance of everyone who wishes you\u2019d just stay down. Rooted in Place Rooted in Place makes you as immovable as your stubborn refusal to learn from your mistakes. Become a walking, talking roadblock, laughing in the face of knockback effects like they\u2019re just another bad idea to ignore. Now you can stand your ground with all the grace of a mule in a windstorm. Smush Killing with your feet. Your bare, beautiful feet.\\n Taking your bare foot, placing it on top of a living, conscious life, and then pressing lovingly down until that life ceases to be. Is there a more noble way to kill? \\n The amount of pressure you can bring to bear upon an enemy with your unshod foot is increased by 10% with each level of this skill. Snitch Snitch lets you call in the cavalry whenever you find yourself in a situation that\u2019s just a bit too hot to handle. Great for tattling on enemies and bringing the guards running\u2014because nothing says \u201cI\u2019ve got this\u201d like immediately calling for backup. Ideal for cowards who want to look like heroes without doing any of the heavy lifting. Steelie Skin Steelie Skin makes your flesh tougher as your health drops, which is just as well since you\u2019ll probably be getting hit a lot with your lack of actual combat skills. As you take damage, you get harder to kill, like a cockroach that\u2019s somehow survived three nuclear winters and refuses to die, out of spite. StepSon StepSon enhances your foot-based attacks, which is great news for anyone who\u2019s ever wanted to weaponize their daddy issues. Inflict stagger with a good kick and leave your enemies dazed, confused, and possibly questioning why they\u2019re even here. Kick your way to victory, because using your fists is so last year. Talon Strike Birds have ugly feet. Disgusting feet, really. Still, there\u2019s something sensual about the sight of a hawk swooping down upon its prey, talons out, and slashing. It\u2019s so sudden, so unexpected, so explosively violent. \\n Such violence. Sweet, sweet violence. \\n Turns the side of your bare foot into a fast-moving slashing weapon, increasing the damage against opponents by up to (Level of skill) times your regular kicking damage for (Level of skill) seconds. Each kick using this skill has a 2% chance to cast the instakill spell Eviscerate. This melee skill has a cooldown of five minutes. Higher levels of this skill increase damage, duration, and chance of casting Eviscerate. A level 15 of this skill will result in Talon Strike being permanently active. Tent the House Tent the House lets you turn any potion into a wide-area effect, spreading the benefits (or detriments) to anyone within spitting distance. It\u2019s ideal for those who believe that sharing is caring\u2014especially when sharing a deadly poison or an explosive buff gone wrong. Precision Archer Precision Archer lets you hit your targets with pinpoint accuracy, assuming your shaky hands and poor life choices don\u2019t get in the way. Perfect for when you want to feel like Legolas but end up looking more like an amateur dart player at a rowdy pub. Gunslinger Gunslinger improves your firearm skills, letting you shoot faster and more accurately. Because when it comes to handling firearms, what could go wrong with faster shooting? Great for wannabe desperados who have more bravado than actual skill. Blade Dancer Blade Dancer turns you into a whirling dervish of death, swinging your blades around like you\u2019re auditioning for the deadliest ballet ever. Gain speed and style, making your enemies die in awe\u2014or maybe just out of sheer embarrassment for you. Siege Breaker Siege Breaker is for those who think the best defense is a good offense and the best offense is a large, blunt object. Swing your heavy weapon with the kind of reckless abandon usually only exhibited by Golden Corral patrons on fried chicken night. You\u2019ll be smashing through enemies and defenses like a black guy smashing his way through a weight watcher\u2019s meeting.",
