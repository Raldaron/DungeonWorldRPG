First used in Earth warfare in 904 AD, gunpowder is a low explosive, meaning it deflagrates (burns quickly) rather than detonates, and has a generally low brisance (shattering capability). As a result, it is good at throwing metal but not at breaking rock or fortifications. In the Dungeon, gunpowder must be collected in satchels to be stored in inventory. Crawlers may receive heavy leather satchels of gunpowder in Goblin Boxes, or loot it from mobs such as goblins on the First Floor.",
